# Meter-Reader
Collects meter readings


This is set up specifically for my printers, but can be adjusted easily I think.  

I'm fairly new to any of this, and everything self taught, if you see something that should be better please let me know and show me my mistakes...

I'm playing around with the idea of creating a gui that lets you choose specific printers to get the meters from, not that I'd actually need it for work, just something to practice at.
